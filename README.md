I'm from Mars!

It's me, Szilard Mate. You've probably never heard of me. And I've never tought of writing a README for myself. Usually READMEs are written for applications and softwares, but here I'm writing a README about me. READ me. And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the `Star` button.

:bulb: **Tip:** Remember to appreciate the little things in life.
